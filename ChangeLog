	* Now effects uses a shared buffer for temporary frame buffer.
	  But the effects uses large amount buffer(QuarkTV, BaltanTV, StreakTV)
	  alloctes buffers by themselves.
	* Return values of xxxStart() and xxxDraw() are handled. When they
	  failed, drawErrorPattern() is called.(currently it only fill the screen
	  in blank)
