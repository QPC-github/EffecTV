EffecTV 0.1.4

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
EffecTV is a real-time video effector. It runs on SDL and video4linux.

INSTALL
=======

Requirements
------------
Currently, EffecTV highly depends on Intel architecture. It may not
work on any other platform.

Video capture card supported by video4linux is required.

EffecTV requires SDL library, available from http://www.libsdl.org/.

EffecTV uses video4linux. Your kernel should be configured with 
CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV and enable drivers for your video capture card.

Bttv driver included in linux-2.2.18 is broken. Get latest bttv driver
from http://www.strusel007.de/linux/bttv/.

NASM is required to assemble some modules. See following URL:

Compiling & installing

make

and copy "effectv" to anywhere.

The device file (typically "/dev/video") must be readable and writable
for you.
