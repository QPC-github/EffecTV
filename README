EffecTV 0.2.99

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
EffecTV is a real-time video effect processor. You can enjoy movies,
TV programs and any other video stream through the many amazing effects. 

INSTALL
=======

Requirements
------------
Currently, EffecTV highly depends upon the Intel architecture. It may not work on any
other platform.

Video capture card or USB device supported by video4linux is required.

EffecTV requires the SDL library, available from http://www.libsdl.org/.

EffecTV uses video4linux. Your kernel should be configured with 
CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV and enable drivers for your video capture card.

Bttv driver included in linux-2.2.18 is broken. Get latest bttv driver
from http://www.bytesex.org/bttv/.

Vloopback device driver is required for the video loopback feature.
http://motion.technolust.cx/vloopback/index.html
vloopback-0.83 fails to compile on linux-2.4.3 or later. Read README.vloopback
and apply the patch.

NASM is required to assemble some modules. See following URL:
http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/nasm/

Compiling & installing
----------------------
Currently there is no configure script. Modify Makefile and do 

make

and copy "effectv" to anywhere.

The input device file (typically "/dev/video") must be readable and writable for you.

Recording/broadcasting EffecTV
------------------------------
EffecTV has supported the use of a  video loopback device since
version 0.2.0.  First, load the vloopback device driver module and
verify the input/output device files for the video pipe (typically
/dev/video1 and /dev/video2).
Then, run EffecTV.

$ effectv -vloopback /dev/video1

The effected images can be read from /dev/video2. If you want to
'chain' a second instance of EffecTV, type as following.

$ effectv -device /dev/video2

For XawTv,

$ xawtv -c /dev/video2
