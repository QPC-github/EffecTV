TODO list for EffecTV 0.1.x
===========================

Bug
---
* I only tested EffecTV on bttv(bt848 and bt878) and XFree86 3.3.6.
  Please send a report when EffecTV runs or not at your environment.
* There may be many bugs in documents. I am not good at writing in English,
  so please revise them and tell me what is wrong. Your mail is great help
  for me who is learning English.

Future works
------------
* Resource sharing. Some effects have same objects separately.
* Code sharing. Scaling, background subtraction, etc.
* Optimizing (MMX instractions seems well)
* SDL-1.2
* Video4Linux2
* Other platform(BSD, SGI, Sun, MS-Windows,...)
* GUI for changing channel, tuning TV, selecting effects, etc.
* Horizontal flip
* Plug-in mechanism

New effect
----------
Please send your effect!

Memo
----
* I implemented background subtraction function in various ways.
  Which is best way? How about another?
