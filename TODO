TODO for EffecTV ver. 0.1.0
===========================

Bug
---
* EffecTV crashes on linux frame buffer device? 
* I only tested on bttv(bt848 and bt878). Please report when EffecTV
  runs or not with your video capturing device.
* Fix the bugs in documents. I am not good at writing in English, so
  please revise them and tell me what is wrong. Your mail is great help
  for me who is learning English.

Future works
------------
* Resource sharing. Some effects have same objects separately.
* Code sharing. Scaling, differentiation, etc.
* Optimizing.(MMX?)
* SDL-1.2
* Video4Linux2
* Other platform(BSD, SGI, Sun,...)
* GUI for changing channel, tuning TV, selecting effects, etc.
* Horizontal flip.

New effect
----------
Please send your effect!

Memo
----
* I implemented differentiation function in various ways. Evaluate them,
  and decide which is best.
