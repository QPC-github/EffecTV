Bug

* Please send us a report when EffecTV does not work on your machine.
  The name of video capturing device, device driver version, kernel version
  must be included at least.
* Vloopback support is not tested hardly. Your report is welcome.
* There may be many bugs in documents. I am not good at writing in English,
  so please revise them and tell me what is wrong. Your mail is great help
  for me who is learning English.

Future works
------------
* Optimizing. (MMX instructions seems well)
* Video4Linux2 and other drivers
* Other platform(BSD, SGI, Sun, MS-Windows, BeOS,...)
* GUI for changing channel, tuning TV, selecting effects, etc.
* I found that remote controlling is also important for VJ work...
* Plug-in mechanism
* Software deinterlacing

Most impressive essence of EffecTV is interactivity. How can I add
interactivity to AgingTV, ShagadelicTV or other?
