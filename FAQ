Q1: I got a distorted/still/gray scale/shrunken image.

A: Check the signal format (the 'norm') of the video source; it will
most likely be either NTSC, PAL, SECAM, or one of their variants.  You
can then specify which format EffecTV should use with the "-norm"
option on the command line.  For example, when you have a video camera
which employs the PAL system, Try

$ effectv -norm pal

ntsc, pal, secam are supported by video4linux. pal-m, pal-n, pal-nc, ntsc-jp
are supported by latest bttv driver.
----------
Q2: TV seems to work fine, but how can I change to Composite1 or any other
video source?

A: Try
$ effectv -channel 1

Typically, meaning of the number is; 0=TV/1=Composite1/2=S-Video/3=Composite2.
This depends on the implementation of the video capturing card. Try several
numbers to detect the right one.
----------
Q3: Some effects do not work.

A: Older versions EffecTV employed gray scaled capturing mode that
some drivers do not support. Since version 0.2.0, all of the effects
use a 320x240xRGB32 capturing mode, supported by most drivers.
Please update your EffecTV to latest version.
----------
Q4: EffecTV is frozen.

A: The bttv driver that comes with linux-2.2.18 is broken. Try the
latest bttv driver available at http://www.strusel007.de/linux/bttv/.
You also will need to apply the i2c patch for the linux kernel,
available at the same location.

Thank you, Malk.

Q6: Why don't you port EffecTV to ANY-GREAT-OS?

A: I want to do that if I could. But,
a) I have only linux machine and MS-Windows machine.
b) I dislike programming on MS-Windows.

I would like to encourage people who want to port EffecTV to another
environment; The whole CVS tree is now served at SourceForge. If you are
interested, see http://sourceforge.net/projects/effectv/. Please let me know
when you start your porting project, so that I can make a new CVS branch. If
you want to maintain the CVS tree directly, get an account at SourceForge and
tell me your ID. I will add your ID to the EffecTV developers group.
----------
Q7: How can I capture the video output from EffecTV to harddisk?

A: EffecTV can output the effected images to a video loopback device since version
0.2.0. First, you should download Jeroen Vreeken's vloopback driver from
http://motion.technolust.cx/vloopback/index.html, and install the module.
Then, load the module and check the input and output device files of the video
pipe (typically it will be /dev/video1 and /dev/video2). Then, run EffecTV

$ effectv -vloopback /dev/video1

The effected images can be retrieved from /dev/video2. At the moment, EffecTV
does not support some pixel format, so some applications do not work.
----------
Q8: EffecTV is slow.

A: EffecTV uses a screen depth of 32 bits per pixel. When you launch EffecTV
on a screen with another depth, images are converted to that depth by SDL, and it
makes EffecTV a little slow. If you are using X11, try to run it in 32 bpp depth mode.

If your video capturing device does not support 32bit pixel format, EffecTV
converts captured images to 32bit format. This also makes EffecTV slow.
